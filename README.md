# Experiment-Participant-Welcome-Screen
The welcome screen allows participants to create their 5-digit ID or to generate one randomly. An MD5 Hash is generated for the participant ID.
The participant ID, participant HASH, and the length of the participant ID and HASH are provided to the user as labels. 
The text box is limited to not accept entries greater than 5 digits. A warning label pops up if participants enter an ID less than 5 digits.
The participant IDs and HASHs and their lengths are stored in an Excel sheet.
When a new ID is created, it is cross-referenced against those in the Excel sheet to prevent repetition. If an ID has already been used, a warning label pops asking the user to choose a different ID. 
The exit button is a picture of a frog :)

(shout out to Dr. Feinberg for coming up with such a great lab assignment)
